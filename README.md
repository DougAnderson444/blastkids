A BLS12-381 child key derivation library written in Rust. Implements EIP-2333 and EIP-2334.

Fork of [rust-bls-derivation](https://github.com/taiyi-research-institute/rust-bls-derivation) using [`bls12_381_plus`](https://github.com/mikelodder7/bls12_381_plus) instead of [`curv-kzen`](https://crates.io/crates/curv-kzen), plus cleanup and documentation.

## Rationale

If you want to use Delegatable Anonymous Credentials the verification key (`VK`) becomes as long as the credential entries. Since a `VK` is simply several BLS12-381 public keys (`PK`s) we can use a derivation algorithm such as EIP-2333 in order to derive the long `VK` from a single root `PK` given any length.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install blastkids
```

## API & Docs

See documentation on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/blastkids).

See tests in [`lib.rs`](./src/lib.rs) for example usage.

```rust
use blastkids::{Manager, Seed, derive};
use blastkids::{G1, G2};

// make a new manager for a G2 public key
let seed = Seed::new([42u8; 32]);
let manager: Manager<G2> = Manager::from_seed(seed);

// With a Manager you can create as many account sas you need
let account_number = 1u32;
let account = manager.account(account_number);

let length = 8u8; // Specify how many Child Public Keys you need (in this case, 8). Can be up to 255.

// Anyone can use an Account Public Key and a `length` to derive a child account
let child_account: Vec<G2> = derive(&account.pk, length);

// When you want to use the child account secret keys,
// you call `sized` on the account
let child = account.sized(length);

// This child public keys are the same as the ones derived above
assert_eq!(child.pk, child_account);
```

## Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

## Prior Work

- [EIP-2333](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2333)
- [EIP-2334](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2334)
- [rust-bls-derivation](https://github.com/taiyi-research-institute/rust-bls-derivation) (circa 2023, uses [`curv-kzen`](https://crates.io/crates/curv-kzen) library which breaks with rust-nightly and appears somewhat unmaintained)
